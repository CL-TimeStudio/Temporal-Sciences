### 🌀 Temporal Sciences  


**Redefining Time, Space, and the Structure of Reality**  
_A rotational framework unifying gravity, light, energy, and mass through the geometry of time._

---

### Overview

Temporal Sciences is a multi-disciplinary new science that represents the foundational code, concepts, and documents of a new speculative framework proposing that the universe is not governed by static forces, but by **rotating timefields**. Rather than treating mass, energy, distance, and time as isolated constants, Temporal Sciences models them as **phase-aligned vectors** embedded in a shared temporal manifold.

> 🧠 *“This is not just a theory — it’s a geometry remembered.”*

Temporal Sciences introduces a geometry-first paradigm that redefines:

- **Gravity** as the curvature of timeflow  
- **Light** as the angular projection of time into distance  
- **Fine-Structure Constant (α)** as a quantized misalignment angle  
- **c and G** as projections of temporal resonance, not fixed constants  
- **Mass, Energy, Distance, Time** as rotationally coupled fields

### 📌 Current State – *Phase I Complete, Phase II Begins*

Phase I laid the mathematical foundation, uncovering the **Foundational Function of the Universe** and validating a **phase-locked curvature geometry** across cosmic and subatomic scales.

### 🧠 Featured Concepts

- **Chronotensity (X⋔)**: The dynamic intensity of the timefield, replacing G.  
- **Chronomatrix (X⧖)**: A time-based structural curvature field.  
- **Chronorate (⧖) = dT/dt**: The rate of actual time relative to measured time.  
- **Phase Geometry**: Core quantities rotate in phase-space; misalignment creates gravity, light, and structure.  
- **α as Rotation**: The fine-structure constant is a wedge of misalignment, not a force coupling term.  
- **Tetrahedral Resonance**: Cosmic constants echo within baryonic matter via rotational symmetry.
