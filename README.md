# Time-and-Space  
**A collection of speculative definitions for time and space**

This repository contains my novel and speculative definitions of time, alongside a forthcoming unified framework for fundamental quantities. My intention is to share these ideas as a starting point for analysis and exploration.

## About This Work  
- **Non-peer-reviewed:** This work represents my personal research and has not undergone peer review or external evaluation.  
- **Progress and Motivation:** I find the progress and direction this work is taking me fascinating and believe it challenges the foundational frameworks currently available. While these ideas are still in development, I hope they spark interest and discussion.  

## Contents  
1. **Time and Distance: A New Approach**  
   This document reexamines the conventional understanding of time as a universal constant, proposing instead that "clock time" measures the rate of change of actual time. It introduces a framework suggesting an equivalency between time and distance, analogous to Einstein's energy-mass equivalency. The work explores mathematical relationships linking time, distance, mass, and energy, and tests these ideas against the estimated age of the universe. While untested and unreviewed, this exploration is intended to spark discussion and offer fresh perspectives on the interplay of fundamental forces and constants.

3. **Universe Framework for Time, Distance, Energy, and Mass**  
   Building upon the concepts in *Time and Distance: A New Approach*, proposed here is a framework for how time, distance, energy, and mass relate to each other within a universe.

2. **Time Defines the Gravitational Constant and Fundamental Spacetime Curvature**  
   Building upon the concepts in *Time and Distance: A New Approach* and *Universe Framework for Time, Distance, Energy, and Mass*, proposed here is how the temporal rate of change for the universe defines time.

I hope you find this work engaging as a speculative framework and an alternative perspective on these fundamental concepts.

Thank you for your time,
