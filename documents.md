# Documents & Frameworks

This page lists all publicly released Temporal Sciences documents in chronological order.

**➤ Temporal Sciences (TS): A Weak-Field Reparameterization of the Classic Tests**

This note shows that a compact reparameterization of Newton’s constant can reproduce the canonical weak-field tests of GR using only angles and ratios, without changing any empirical predictions. Light bending, Shapiro delay, perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, and the PSR B1913+16 orbital-decay benchmark all match standard values within quoted uncertainties.

**➤ The Foundational Function of the Universe**

This document introduces the core equation of the Temporal Sciences framework, formally defining the rotational structure underlying the universe. The function expresses time (T), mass (m), energy (E), and distance (D) as co-rotating temporal fields within a 3-dimensional phase space of misalignment. This phase-based formulation replaces force-centric models with geometric coherence, revealing the true manifold from which gravity, structure, and timeflow emerge.

**➤ The Rotational Geometry That Drives the Universe**

This document introduces and formalizes the foundational geometry of the Temporal Sciences framework — a unified, rotational model of the universe in which actual time T, mass m, energy E, and distance D are phase-locked fields embedded in a dynamic curvature manifold. Departing from classical force-based paradigms, this work reinterprets gravitational behavior, the fine-structure constant α, and the speed of light c as emergent consequences of rotational misalignment within a temporally curved space.

**➤ Temporal Sciences – Nexus: Defining Time, Gravity, and the Universe**

This document serves as the Nexus for Temporal Sciences, a new branch of science dedicated to the study of time and its fundamental role in the universe. The elements contained within this document are foundational to the creation of a model of our universe from a temporal perspective (the Temporal Model). As a living document, it will be continuously refined and expanded as new insights emerge.

**➤ Eliminating Dark Energy from the Friedmann Equations: A Temporal Approach**

The standard model of cosmology relies on the cosmological constant Lambda (dark energy) to explain the universe’s accelerating expansion, but its necessity remains an open question. This work proposes a temporal reinterpretation of the Friedmann equations, showing that cosmic acceleration can be explained through time evolution rather than an external force. By redefining gravity as a time-dependent quantity, I derive modified Friedmann equations that eliminate the need for Lambda.

This approach suggests that dark energy is not a distinct physical entity but an artifact of misinterpreting time’s role in cosmic expansion, offering a new framework for understanding cosmic evolution.

**➤ Hubble Tension: The Temporal Resolution**

This work explores a novel perspective on the Hubble constant, proposing that it is not a fixed value to be discovered but one intrinsically linked to the rate of temporal change within the universe. The current value of the Hubble constant is presented as necessary to align with the present rate of temporal change, ensuring the invariance of the gravitational constant.

**➤ Time Defines the Gravitational Constant and Fundamental Spacetime Curvature**

This work shows that the rate of change in time for the universe defines the gravitational constant for the universe and defines the fundamental curvature for spacetime. This work removes current limits to our knowledge and offers new approaches to comprehensively understand how spacetime operates universally and not just on local scales.

**➤ Universe Framework for Time, Distance, Energy, and Mass**

This work builds on the concepts outlined in *Time and Distance: A New Approach* and proposes a speculative framework exploring the interrelationships among time, distance, energy, and mass within the context of the universe. Focusing on the domains of relativity and cosmology, this work aims to inspire discussion and exploration of these foundational principles.

**➤ Time and Distance: A New Approach**

This document reexamines the conventional understanding of time as a universal constant, proposing instead that "clock time" measures the rate of change of actual time. It introduces a framework suggesting an equivalency between time and distance, analogous to Einstein's energy-mass equivalency.

The work explores mathematical relationships linking time, distance, mass, and energy, testing these ideas against the estimated age of the universe. Though untested and unreviewed, this exploration aims to spark discussion and provide fresh perspectives on the interplay of fundamental forces and constants.
