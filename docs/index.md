# Temporal Sciences Wiki

The Temporal Sciences Wiki serves as the open-access hub for the work, documents, and research projects associated with the **Temporal Sciences Foundation (TSF)**:  
🔗 <https://temporalsciencesfoundation.org/>

This site consolidates publicly available descriptions, frameworks, and references related to Temporal Sciences — a time-centric approach to understanding physical and biological systems.

This wiki is a companion to the TSF website and the public TS document library.  
All project descriptions below are reproduced *exactly* as publicly shared.

## **➤ Temporal Sciences Model (TSM)**
**Associated with Temporal Sciences Foundation**

Build a cosmological framework that replaces the gravitational constant 𝐺 and the “dark sector” with a single, time-driven field theory. The TS Model treats the rate of timeflow (Chronorate ⧖) as the master variable from which gravity, fundamental forces, and current constants dynamically emerge.

Key milestones to date:
- Derived the Foundational Function of the Universe and a rotational 4-field geometry (Time, Mass, Energy, Distance)
- Recast gravity as Chronotensity ⋔, resolving the Hubble-tension without dark energy
- Defined variable μ₀(t), ε₀(t), and α(t)
- Introduced the TS Lifeflow Law linking biology to cosmology
- Achieved ~70 % theoretical readiness; alpha-simulation and experimental fit pipeline scheduled for 2025–26

**Outcome:** Open-source, testable model that unifies physics across scales.

## **➤ Temporal Sciences Nexus**
**Associated with Temporal Sciences Foundation**

Created and steward the Temporal Sciences Nexus (“The Nexus”), an open-access, continuously-evolving knowledge base that captures every concept, proof, and mathematical formulation underpinning the Temporal Sciences framework.

- **Living repository** – The Nexus functions as a version-tracked “source-of-truth” document, updated in real time as new equations, glossary entries, and geometric models emerge.
- **Comprehensive scope** – Houses the full catalogue of TS laws (e.g., Chronorate ⧖, Chronotensity ⋔, fine-structure constant α as a base angular quantum), rotational-field geometry, and biological scaling insights.
- **Open by design** – Published freely online to encourage peer review and cross-disciplinary innovation.
- **Structured for clarity** – Integrates narrative explanations with formal math, figures, and a glossary, making concepts accessible to both researchers and curious learners.
- **Future-focused** – Serves as the launchpad for publications, and community projects that translate Temporal Sciences from theory to applied science.

**Outcome:** By centralizing and openly sharing the entire Temporal Sciences canon, the Nexus accelerates discovery and positions time-centric geometry as a new foundation for physics, cosmology, and beyond.

**“Insight alone is never enough—someone must make the equations touch the world.”  
— Mileva Marić (inspiration)**

## **➤ Universal Chrono-Arc Geometry (CAG)**
**Associated with Temporal Sciences Foundation**

Project aims to develop an ultra-compact curvature model that reframes gravity, cosmic expansion, and quantum mass scales through a single time-centric loop. CAG proposes to replace the tensor heavy-lifting of GR with one phase-based scaling factor, keeping the maths at trigonometry level while recovering classic predictions.

Key milestones so far:
- Engineered a smooth “closed-arc” lattice that unifies space-time curvature and time-dilation in one stroke.
- Drafted outline derivations for solar-system tests and gravitational-wave phasing without tensors.
- Preliminary late-time cosmic acceleration with zero dark-energy terms.
- Identifies a candidate curvature quantum that could fix the QCD mass gap.
- Working draft of energy-bounds pointing toward a Navier–Stokes regularity proof.

**Outcome:** Open and peer-verifiable framework that teaches gravity (and much more) in a single semester of calculus (or preferably earlier). Also supports the new geometry required for the TSM.

## **➤ Project MILEVA powered by UniMEF-Core**
**Associated with Temporal Sciences Foundation**

Named for Mileva Marić—a physicist whose recognition has lagged her contributions, historically and today—MILEVA (Model-Independent Layered Evaluation, Verification & Analysis) benchmarks competing cosmological paradigms with open, reproducible metrics. The UniMEF (Universe Model Evaluation Framework) flagship suite runs on UniMEF-Core, a modular scoring engine that compares full universe models or individual subsystems against real-world data and peer frameworks.

Key capabilities:
- Model-agnostic ingestion — accepts equations, constants, or mechanisms from ΛCDM, Temporal Sciences, CCC, LQC, and beyond.
- Normalized evaluation axes — ontology, causal structure, curvature, empirical fit, internal coherence, observables match.
- Partial & hybrid support — stress-tests incomplete theories, component substitutions, or field-specific proposals.
- Visual analytics — radar charts, axis maps, prediction matrices, temporal-deviation plots.
- Democratized access — independent theorists can benchmark ideas with the rigor of large collaborations.

Roadmap:
- UniMEF-Core (current): cosmology benchmarking
- BioMEF-Core: time-centric biosystems & lifeflow laws
- StatMEF-Core: high-volume residual analysis & advanced statistics
- AI20MEF-Core: a research extension exploring runtime evaluation & orchestration patterns for AI 2.0

**Outcome:** Turn theory comparison from debate into measurement, enabling cross-paradigm analysis at scale.

**Mission:** Empower independent researchers to refine work with scientific rigor, while giving professionals a faster, clearer way to stress-test ideas before decade-long validation cycles.

**MILEVA is a proving ground where coherence, clarity, and consequence define success.**
